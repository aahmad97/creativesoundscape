# creativesoundscape
The creative soundscape is a system that plays back samples in response to user actions (using MAX UI objects) to control the overall mix of sound cues. This concept avoids the idea of a fixed timeline (press play and listen to the end), instead giving control of not only duration but also musical/sonic texture to the user/listener.
